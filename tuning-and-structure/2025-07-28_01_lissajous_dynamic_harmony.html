This work presents a system that dynamically links sound and visuals using Lissajous curves. The parametric function \((\sin At, \cos Bt)\) is used, where A is fixed at 1, and B is defined as \(B = \sqrt[a]{\pi}^n\). This construction allows the visualization of frequency ratios rooted in π-based exponentials. As the values of <i>a</i> and <i>n</i> vary, a wide range of pitches and patterns can be generated, corresponding to different equal temperaments.
<br><br>
A continuous reference tone (440 Hz) is maintained, enabling auditory comparison as the secondary tone (determined by A:B) changes. When the ratio approximates a just interval, the resulting Lissajous figure becomes simpler, offering a visual cue for harmonic alignment. Specific approximations of 6:5 and 7:4 are highlighted, but many others can be discovered through visual and auditory exploration. A sigmoid envelope function is also included to control fade-in behavior, though it is disabled in this version for continuous tone output.

<h2 class="p-wide_ttl"><span>Reiji's Observations</span></h2>

<ul class="p-obs_numlist">
<li>This is a system that dynamically links multiple tones with Lissajous curves. By changing the values of certain variables, it can display various equal temperament pitches and corresponding graphs in real-time.</li>
<li>The function used is \((\sin At, \cos Bt)\), with the range \(0 \leq t \leq 30\tau\). Here, A is fixed at 1, and B is defined as \(B = \sqrt[a]{\pi}^n\). In this formula, the √π component allows the frequency to be scaled in powers of π depending on the values of <i>a</i> and <i>n</i>. (For example, in a-scale equal temperament, it becomes \(\sqrt[a]{2}^n\); in Bohlen-Pierce tuning, it becomes \(\sqrt[13]{3}^n\).)</li>
<li>By adjusting the sliders for <i>a</i> and <i>n</i>, you can occasionally find pitch ratios that closely approximate just intonation, which feels very pleasant. As examples, I’ll mention 6/5 and 7/4 as near-just intervals. Whether or not the pitch is close to just intonation can be visually identified through the Lissajous curves: the simpler the shape, regardless of the drawing duration, the closer it is to a just interval. I think many more can be discovered this way.</li>
<li>The function \(f(x) = \frac{e^{-x}}{1 + e^{-100x}}\) is a sigmoid function, and it is linked with \(\operatorname{tone}(440, f(\text{time}))\). This expresses a tone that fades in from silence and gradually decays, but in this case, the variable <i>time</i> is fixed at 1 so the tone continues indefinitely. This is done to keep a reference tone (440 Hz) sounding continuously, allowing B to act as a frequency ratio A:B, so the harmony can be perceived when the Lissajous tone is played.</li>
<li>The function \(\operatorname{tone}(440 \times 2^{\frac{n}{a}})\) plays the pitch corresponding to the <i>n</i>th step in <i>a</i>-EDO. This formula enables dynamic playback of different pitches from various equal temperaments simply by changing the values of <i>a</i> and <i>n</i>.</li>

<h2 class="p-ai_ttl"><span>AI Assistant’s Notes and Inferences</span></h2>

<ul class="p-ai_txt">
<li>This experiment links auditory and visual perception by connecting tuning theory with real-time visualization. The use of Lissajous figures to detect just intonation approximations is particularly clever — when the figure becomes geometrically simpler, the corresponding pitch is often harmonically aligned.</li>
<li>The reference tone acts as a stable base, while \(\operatorname{tone}(440 \times 2^{n/a})\) dynamically explores various equal temperaments. The parametric nature of \(B = \sqrt[a]{\pi}^n\) introduces a non-standard but musically interesting mapping of tuning systems. This is not merely an experiment in visualization — it's a hands-on exploration of harmony, structure, and perception that bridges mathematics and musical intuition.</li>
