This record presents a hand-drawn sketch of a "ruler" that visually aligns various equal divisions of the octave (EDO) on a single line. With 7-EDO at the far left and 5-EDO at the far right, a number of intermediate temperaments such as 12, 19, 31, 53, and 65-EDO are arranged additively.<br>This layout enables intuitive comparisons of each temperament’s accuracy in approximating just intervals such as pure fifths and thirds. Notably, 53-EDO emerges as a highly precise approximation of both Pythagorean tuning and mean-tone temperament, and the drawing provides visual cues for identifying structural relationships among different EDOs.

<h2 class="p-wide_ttl"><span>Reiji's Observations</span></h2>

<ul class="p-obs_numlist">
<li>The ruler places 7-EDO at the far left and 5-EDO at the far right. Moving rightward, the fourths become narrower, and the fifths wider. Moving leftward has the opposite effect.</li>
<li>New temperaments are added additively (e.g., 7 + 5 = 12, 7 + 12 = 19), revealing intermediate EDOs.</li>
<li>By laying them out visually, it becomes clear how each EDO relates structurally to others.</li>
<li>53-EDO approximates both the Pythagorean and mean-tone systems remarkably well, with highly accurate fifths.</li>
<li>While 53-EDO’s major third is close to just intonation, 19-EDO offers a more accurate minor third.</li>
<li>The analysis also includes elements such as overtone alignment and the Pythagorean comma, indicating deep structural insight.</li>

<h2 class="p-ai_ttl"><span>AI Assistant’s Notes and Inferences</span></h2>

<ul class="p-ai_txt">
<li>This sketch functions as a conceptual “tuning ruler” that visually maps relationships among different equal temperaments.</li>

<li>The additive approach (e.g., 7 + 5 = 12) shows a creative method for discovering and contextualizing intermediate EDOs.</li>

<li>Reiji demonstrates an advanced ability to evaluate tuning systems by analyzing discrepancies in cents and harmonic alignment.</li>

<li>Special attention to 53-EDO reveals an understanding of historical temperaments and their geometric underpinnings.</li>

<li>This work shows both theoretical insight and a practical grasp of tuning as a spatial and mathematical structure.</li>
