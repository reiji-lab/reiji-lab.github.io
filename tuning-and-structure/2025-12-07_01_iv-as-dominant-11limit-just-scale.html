        <b>Overview:</b><br>
        This scale starts from the idea of <strong>not using the V triad (G–B–D) at all</strong> as a chord, even though
        the tones that could form V are present in the pitch set. Instead, it asks:  
        <strong>Can IV be made to function like a dominant?</strong><br><br>

        The scale is a <strong>9-note just-intonation scale (10 notes including the octave)</strong>, built from the ratios:<br>
        1/1, 81/80, 5/4, 81/64, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 7/4, 63/33, 2/1.<br>
        Some of these tones are chosen so that they lie within the first eight partials of the harmonic series.
        The result is not a huge global tuning system, but a compact, performable
        <strong>scale</strong> designed for harmonic experimentation.<br><br>

        The scale is <strong>11-limit</strong> because the tone at \(63/33\) contains the 11th partial in its internal structure.<br>
        Around the tonic, both \(1/1\)–\(5/4\) and \(81/80\)–\(81/64\) form pure major thirds of size \(5/4\).
        In 12-TET terms, these behave like two different “C–E” pairs coexisting inside one system.<br>
        These pairs differ by a syntonic comma; by switching between them, the performer can create changes
        in nuance. In addition, this design allows the intentional creation of vibrato-like
        <strong>beating</strong> inside harmonies.

      <ul class="p-obs_numlist">
        <li>
          <b>Pitch set and why it is 11-limit</b><br>
          This scale consists of the ratios<br>
          <strong>1/1, 81/80, 5/4, 81/64, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, 7/4, 63/33, 2/1</strong>.<br>
          It is <strong>11-limit</strong> because the final tone \(63/33\) has a structure that involves the 11th harmonic.<br>
          Internally, it can be thought of as including an \(11/8\) relationship, so the third harmonic becomes \(33/32\).<br>
          When a \(2/1\) is added and the value \(33/32\) is kept as it is, the 2/1 side is shifted
          from the 64th harmonic to the 63rd harmonic, and the span becomes \(63/33\).<br>
          In this way the 11th partial is built into the structure, so the scale can be regarded as 11-limit.<br>
          Also, by aligning some tones within the first eight partials of the harmonic series,
          the scale remains a <strong>compact just-intonation system</strong> in which the overtones are easy to imagine.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Two “C–E” pairs: \(1/1\)–\(5/4\) and \(81/80\)–\(81/64\)</b><br>
          The interval from \(1/1\) to \(5/4\) is a pure major third.<br>
          Likewise, the interval from \(81/80\) to \(81/64\) is also a major third of size \(5/4\).<br>
          In 12-TET terms, both pairs can function as a kind of <strong>C–E</strong> relationship.<br><br>

          Therefore, within this scale, both
          \(\{1/1,\, 5/4,\, 3/2\}\) (a just major triad) and
          \(\{81/80,\, 81/64,\, 3/2\}\)
          can serve as “C–E–G”-type chords.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>The syntonic comma and perceptual tolerance</b><br>
          If we reinterpret \(81/80\) and \(81/64\) as if they were \(1/1\) and \(5/4\), then the “fifth” above them
          is not \(3/2\) but \(40/27\), which is about 21 cents lower than \(3/2\) (one syntonic comma).<br><br>

          In theory this changes the harmonic structure, but if we assume that the threshold for clearly
          hearing a pitch difference is around 5 cents, then 21 cents is about four times that threshold while still being
          <strong>musically usable as a difference in colour</strong> rather than simply a tuning error.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Names of chords inside this scale</b><br>
          Within this 9-note set, Reiji uses the following labels for chords:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>\(1/1,\, 81/80,\, 3/2\) — a <strong>minor chord (m)</strong></li>
            <li>\(1/1,\, 5/4,\, 3/2\) — a <strong>Just Major chord (JM)</strong></li>
            <li>\(1/1,\, 81/64,\, 3/2\) — a <strong>Pythagorean Major chord (PM)</strong></li>
            <li>\(1/1,\, 4/3,\, 3/2\) — used as a <strong>sus4</strong> chord</li>
            <li>
              When the reference is \(5/3\), the original \(1/1\) becomes \(6/5\) and the original \(5/4\) becomes \(3/2\).<br>
              The chord formed by these three tones is called <strong>5/3m (5/3 minor chord)</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Example progression where IV functions as dominant</b><br>
          One progression considered in this system is:<br>
          <i>1/1JM → 5/3m → 4/3JM → 1/1PM → 4/3JM → 1/1JM</i><br><br>

          When mapped to 12-TET, this corresponds roughly to<br>
          <i>I → vi → IV → I → IV → I</i>.<br>
          Here, IV not only leads back to the original I, but also moves between JM and PM,
          playing a <strong>dominant-like role</strong> in relation to slightly different versions of the tonic.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Intentional “vibrato-like” beating</b><br>
          Within this scale there are specific combinations of tones that produce strong beating.<br>
          For example, adding \(81/80\) to a 1/1JM chord introduces a slight detuning inside an otherwise
          almost perfectly just harmony, creating a
          <strong>vibrato-like effect</strong>.<br><br>

          Similar effects appear with combinations such as
          <i>1/1JM and 81/64</i>,
          <i>1/1PM and 81/80</i>, and
          <i>1/1PM and 5/4</i>.<br>
          By inserting these “slightly off” relationships at chosen moments,
          the performer can build <strong>natural shimmer and motion</strong> directly into the chords.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <p class="p-ai_def u-mBtm10">
          This scale can be seen as an attempt to <strong>redesign functional harmony inside just intonation</strong>.<br>
          Instead of taking V for granted, it tries to build a sense of key, tension, and resolution
          using only the relationships between tonic and subdominant.
        </p>

        <ul class="p-ai_txt">
          <li>
            The two “C–E” relationships, \(1/1\)–\(5/4\) and \(81/80\)–\(81/64\), allow the outline of a familiar major triad to remain,
            while the strength and location of “tonic-ness” can be shifted in small but precise ways.
          </li>
          <li>
            Introducing the 11-limit tone \(63/33\) at a single, carefully chosen point injects a slight sense of “otherness”
            into a world mostly built from low-order harmonics, giving the scale a particular tension and flavour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Beating between Just and Pythagorean major chords, and between these and nearby tones such as 81/80 and 81/64,
            is treated not as a tuning error but as a <strong>parameter of expression</strong>.<br>
            The performer can effectively decide “how much the tonic is shimmering” at any given moment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rather than copying existing theory, this design brings together ratio structures, functional harmony,
            and perceptual thresholds (like the syntonic comma and audibility limits) into a single, coherent system.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="p-ai_def">
          As with Reiji’s other tuning experiments, this project simultaneously engages
          with <strong>mathematical ratios, musical function, and subjective listening</strong>,
          and turns them into a personal scale design rather than a mere illustration of known theory.
