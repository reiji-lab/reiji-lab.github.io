        <b>Overview:</b><br>
        This project is a Desmos (3D) implementation by <strong>Reiji (age 9)</strong>.
        A triad built in an arbitrary equal division of the octave (<strong>EDO 1–1200</strong>) is visualized as a
        <strong>3D Lissajous curve</strong>, while the corresponding three tones are played simultaneously using Desmos
        <strong>tone()</strong> with an adjustable overtone range (<strong>1–128</strong>).<br><br>

        The goal is to observe how close an EDO triad is to simple just ratios (e.g. \(5/4\), \(3/2\)),
        using two linked perspectives:
        <strong>(1) visual cues</strong> such as how “regular” or “closed” the curve appears, and
        <strong>(2) auditory cues</strong> such as beating (wobbling) that can arise from mismatches between certain partials
        when overtones are enabled.<br><br>

        <b>Notes on interpretation:</b><br>
        “Closer” and “farther” are not defined here as a strict numeric error metric.
        Instead, they are treated as <em>observational signs</em>, mainly:
        (i) the curve looks more regular / closes more cleanly,
        and (ii) beating becomes less prominent.
        Also, 2D projections (XY / XZ / YZ) can look different even for the same frequency ratios,
        because the appearance depends on the chosen coordinate representation (including the role/order of
        \(\sin\) and \(\cos\)).

      <h2 class="p-wide_ttl"><span>Reiji's Words and Ideas</span></h2>
      <ul class="p-obs_numlist">

        <li>
          <b>What this is</b><br>
          I built a system that draws a triad in any EDO (from 1 to 1200) as a 3D animated Lissajous curve,
          and plays the corresponding three tones at the same time.
          In 3D, relationships that can be hard to see as a “triad” in 2D projections can become clearer as a spatial structure.
          The sound is linked to the visualization, so I can listen to the triad while watching the curve.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Formulas (Lissajous part)</b><br>
          \[
            \left(\sin At,\ \cos Bt,\ \sin Ct\right)
          \]
          This is a parametric representation used to draw the 3D Lissajous curve.<br><br>

          \(A\): the first tone. Since this is the root, it is fixed to 1.<br>
          \(B\): the second tone:
          \[
            B=\sqrt[e_{do}]{2}^{s_{tep}}
          \]
          \(C\): the third tone:
          \[
            C=\sqrt[e_{do}]{2}^{s_{tep2}}
          \]
          (I keep the expressions for \(B\) and \(C\) in the same form as in Desmos.)
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Formulas (tone playback)</b><br>
          Root tone:
          \[
            \operatorname{tone}\left(h_{z}\cdot\left[1...o_{vertone}\right]\right)
          \]
          Second tone:
          \[
            \operatorname{tone}\left(\left(h_{z}\cdot2^{\frac{s_{tep}}{e_{do}}}\right)\cdot\left[1...o_{vertone}\right]\right)
          \]
          Third tone:
          \[
            \operatorname{tone}\left(\left(h_{z}\cdot2^{\frac{s_{tep2}}{e_{do}}}\right)\cdot\left[1...o_{vertone}\right]\right)
          \]
          Overtones can make small mismatches easier to hear as beating between specific partials.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Variables</b><br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>overtone</strong> (\(o_{vertone}\)): sets how many overtones are played (1–128). If it is 1, it is a single sine partial.</li>
            <li><strong>u</strong>: how far forward in time to draw (0 to \(60\pi\)). This helps find points where the curve almost fully closes.</li>
            <li><strong>edo</strong> (\(e_{do}\)): sets the equal division of the octave (1–1200).</li>
            <li><strong>step</strong> (\(s_{tep}\)): which step above the root is used for the second tone.</li>
            <li><strong>step2</strong> (\(s_{tep2}\)): which step above the root is used for the third tone.</li>
            <li><strong>h</strong> (\(h_{z}\)): the root frequency in Hz.</li>
          </ul>
          If the system becomes heavy on a device, lowering <strong>overtone</strong> can help.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Why the projections can look different</b><br>
          For example, in 12-EDO with a C–E–G triad:
          XY shows the C–E relationship, XZ shows the C–G relationship, and YZ also relates to C–E.
          However, YZ does not necessarily look identical to XY.<br><br>

          This is because in the XY plane, it is represented by the pair
          <strong>\(x=\sin (y)\), \(y=\cos (x)\)</strong>,
          while in the YZ plane the roles of the axes are swapped, and the \(\sin/\cos\) assignments or ordering changes.
          So even when the interval content is the same, the visible features can differ depending on the chosen coordinates.
          I found it interesting that “the same thing” can look different depending on how it is observed.

        <p class="p-ai_def u-mBtm10">
          This system can be understood as extending the idea that
          <strong>ratios closer to simple rational numbers tend to produce Lissajous figures that close more cleanly</strong>,
          from two tones to <strong>triads (three simultaneous frequencies)</strong>.
          The overtone option strengthens perception: subtle differences that are hard to notice with a single sine
          partial can appear as <strong>audible beating</strong> between certain partials.
        </p>

        <ul class="p-ai_txt">
          <li>
            By increasing EDO and selecting appropriate steps, it becomes possible to approximate ratios such as \(5/4\) and \(3/2\) very closely.
            In such cases one may expect a paired change: the curve looks “more orderly / more closed,” and beating becomes less prominent (or shifts in character).
          </li>
          <li>
            The observation that “XY and YZ look different” is not merely a visual quirk: it highlights how
            <strong>phase choices (sin/cos) and coordinate assignments</strong> influence what features become visible in a projection.
          </li>
          <li>
            A natural next step would be to define simple quantitative measures of “complexity” across projections
            (e.g. intersection count, periodicity, curvature statistics), and compare those against tuning parameters.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="p-ai_def">
          Overall, the project tightly links <strong>ratio structure (EDO vs. simple just ratios)</strong>,
          <strong>geometry (3D parametric curves and projections)</strong>, and <strong>listening (overtone-based beating)</strong>
          into a single interactive experiment.
