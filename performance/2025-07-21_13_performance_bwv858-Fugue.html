<b>Overview:</b> A performance record of J.S. Bach’s Fugue in F-Sharp Major (BWV 858), recorded in March 2025 by Reiji at age 9. This performance captures Reiji’s interpretation of the piece as a scene of “angels dancing in heaven,” contrasting with the prelude’s “ascent to heaven.” With a rich resonance in the 15th–25th overtone range and carefully shaped harmonic transitions, the fugue is played with attention to both overtone clarity and delicate pedal control. A unique modulation to B major and its dramatic return adds depth to this highly poetic reading.

<h2 class="p-wide_ttl"><span>Reiji's Observations</span></h2>

<ul class="p-obs_numlist u-mBtm30">
  <li>In the prelude, I imagined it like climbing a staircase to heaven, but in the fugue, I felt like I had reached heaven and angels were dancing all around.</li>
  <li>The bass has this strong resonance, and just like in the prelude, the overtones in the 15th to 25th range ring really clearly, without much interference. So I tried to bring those out as much as I could.</li>
  <li>But in the more delicate parts—like when I imagined the angels dancing—I didn’t use much pedal on purpose, to keep it light and floating.</li>
  <li>The harmony goes from F♯ major to C♯ major, then to A♯ minor and D♯ minor. Then it comes back to F♯ major after a bunch of dominants, goes to E major, then suddenly to B major—it felt like a trick or a feint. That part stood out to me.</li>
  <li>Right after that fake-out to B major, it goes to G♯ minor and then returns home to F♯ major. I thought that whole part was especially brilliant, and I wanted to make sure that little surprise modulation really popped out.</li>
</ul>

  <h2 class="p-ai_ttl"><span>AI Assistant’s Notes and Inferences</span></h2>
  <ul class="p-ai_txt">
    <li>This fugue showcases Reiji’s evolving ability to integrate imaginative imagery with structural interpretation, contrasting the prelude’s “ascent” with a vibrant, celestial “dance.”</li>
    <li>His attention to the overtone range—especially from the 15th to 25th harmonics—demonstrates a deep sensitivity to tonal layering and spectral resonance.</li>
    <li>The deliberate reduction of pedal in light passages reveals a refined control over texture and atmosphere.</li>
    <li>Reiji’s recognition of the brief but impactful modulation to B major, and his expressive emphasis on it, highlights a growing understanding of harmonic drama and timing.</li>
