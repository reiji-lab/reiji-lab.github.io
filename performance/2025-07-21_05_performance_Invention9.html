<b>Overview:</b> A performance record of Bach's Invention No. 9 (BWV 780), recorded in June 2025 by Reiji at age 9. In this rendition, Reiji offers a nuanced interpretation of harmonic rhythm, structural modulation, and overtone mapping—identifying shifts in tonality with precise fractional cadence tracking. This document includes detailed personal insights and acoustic observations.

<h2 class="p-wide_ttl"><span>Reiji's Observations</span></h2>

<p class="p-def_txt">Although this piece is written in 3/4 time, I felt that the harmonic rhythm moves with a 2/4 pulse.<br>
In other words, the beat accents flow like “1-2-3 / 1-2-3,” but the harmonic tension feels like “<b>*1</b>–2–<b>*3</b> / 1–<b>*2</b>–3,” which gave me a unique sense of meter. I performed it with that feeling in mind.</p>

<p class="p-def_txt">I was also struck by the frequent modulations.<br>
The home key is F minor (Fm), but the tonal center shifts several times as follows:</p>

<ul class="p-obs_numlist u-mBtm30">
  <li>0.5th modulation: G minor (Gm) — I counted it as 0.5 because there is no clear cadence.</li>
  <li>1st modulation: C minor (Cm)</li>
  <li>1.25th modulation: B-flat minor (B♭m)</li>
  <li>1.5th modulation: A-flat major (A♭M)</li>
  <li>1.75th modulation: D-flat major (D♭M)</li>
  <li>2nd modulation: Return to F minor (Fm)</li>
</ul>

<p class="p-def_txt">I counted modulations with clear cadences as “1,” and intermediate tonal shifts without cadence as fractional steps like 0.5 or 1.25.<br>
In this way, I interpreted the piece as modulating six times, which gave me the impression that it allows for a wide expressive range.</p>

<p class="p-def_txt">One particularly memorable moment was in bar 24, where the key shifts from F minor to A-flat major, its relative major.<br>
The melodic line and harmonic shift work together to produce a very beautiful effect.</p>

<p class="p-def_txt">Additionally, this piece has a rich overtone structure.<br>
For example, in bar 31, the low C2 can resonate up to the 64th overtone, and in bar 14, the high C6 produces downward partials up to the 39th overtone.<br>
This makes it an excellent piece for practicing overtone control.</p>

<ul class="p-ai_txt">
<li>Reiji’s interpretation is guided by a unique perception of harmonic rhythm and fractional modulation—a perspective not often addressed in typical analyses of this piece.</li>
<li>The emphasis on overtone tracing adds a novel dimension, especially the detailed tracking of low and high overtone structures across specific measures.</li> <li>This recording stands as a strong example of Reiji’s ability to merge theoretical insight with musical expression at a young age.</li>
