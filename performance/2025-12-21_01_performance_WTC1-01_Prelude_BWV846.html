        <b>Overview:</b> A performance of J. S. Bach’s <i>The Well-Tempered Clavier</i>, Book I, No.&nbsp;1 — Prelude in C Major (BWV 846).
        The performer analyzes local sonorities as just-intonation ratios organized “in relation to C,” discusses the syntonic comma as a theoretical mismatch that can arise in chained pure intervals,
        and describes interpretive choices in tone color and harmonic hearing—especially around measure 28 (F♯ vs G♭ interpretation).

      <ul class="p-obs_numlist">
        <li>
          <b>Performer’s Comment — “In relation to C” as a reference point:</b><br>
          When I look at this piece from the perspective of fixing C (Do) as a reference point and organizing the notes as ratios on the overtone series or the undertone series,
          I feel the entire prelude can be understood as a structure “in relation to C.”
          Here, C does not mean the root of each chord; it is simply a reference point for describing ratios.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Opening measures (m. 1–3) — Ratio mapping (local sonorities):</b><br><br>

          <b>Measure 1:</b> C–E–G–C–E (CEGCE). Using C as the reference, it can be organized as the ratios
          <span class="u-subTxt">1, 5/4, 3/2, 2/1, 5/2</span> (overtone-like ratios).<br><br>

          <b>Measure 2:</b> C–D–A–D–F (CDADF). Here, keeping C fixed as the reference, if we prioritize consonance within the sonority and tune F–A as a pure major third (5/4) and A–D as a pure perfect fifth (3/2),
          then D becomes <span class="u-subTxt">10/9</span>.
          As a result, relative to C the measure can be organized as
          <span class="u-subTxt">1, 10/9, 5/3, 20/9, 8/3</span>
          (because of register, the same pitch can appear an octave higher, so D appears as both 10/9 and 20/9).<br><br>

          <b>Measure 3:</b> B–D–G–D–F (BDGDF). Relative to C, it can be organized as
          <span class="u-subTxt">15/16, 9/8, 3/2, 9/4, 8/3</span>.<br><br>

          In this way, when I view local sonorities through just-intonation ratios, many places in the piece feel naturally “well-aligned” with overtones (or undertones),
          and I sensed an overall consonant overtone relationship throughout the prelude.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Drift and the syntonic comma — A theoretical mismatch in strict just intonation:</b><br>
          However, if we try to keep “perfect consonance” continuously in just intonation, there can be a phenomenon where pitches drift downward little by little over time.
          What I describe here is not the claim that this phenomenon is literally happening inside the score; it is an explanation of the theoretical mismatch that can arise when we interpret progressions in strict just intonation.<br><br>

          To illustrate how such a discrepancy can accumulate when we connect intervals as a chain, I take as an example a progression found around measures 9–11
          <span class="u-subTxt">(A &rarr; D &rarr; G)</span>.
          For instance, if we connect A &rarr; D as a pure perfect fifth and D &rarr; G as a pure perfect fourth,
          then there is a difference of <span class="u-subTxt">81/80</span> between G as a reference (3/2) and G obtained as the result of the chain (40/27).
          This <span class="u-subTxt">81/80</span> is called the syntonic comma.<br><br>

          Because this piece is written in equal temperament, the “accumulation of mismatch” that would occur in strict just intonation does not proceed inside the work as-is;
          instead, pitch is held stable by the equal-tempered framework.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Performance approach — Overtone richness and undertone color:</b><br>
          Based on this, in performance I aimed to let overtones resonate richly overall, and in more minor-sounding passages I tried to bring out a more undertone-oriented color (darkness and weight).<br><br>

          Also, around measure 28 I felt the color of the sound shifts noticeably.
          The set of notes there can be interpreted either as a chordal sonority or as part of a flowing texture including passing/ornamental tones, depending on context.
          I chose to treat it as a more “chord-like” sonority, because it can be heard with a diminished-like tension that stands out in this piece.
          In performance, I paid special attention to tone color and overtone production so that the character of this moment would come through clearly.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Example (m. 28) — Ratio mapping if treated as a chordal collection (F♯ vs G♭):</b><br>
          Below is an example of how the ratios can be mapped if we temporarily treat the notes in that measure as a single chordal collection.
          To keep the explanation simple, I assume that up to this point the pitches have not drifted downward
          (without this assumption, we would have to track the drift through the progression, which becomes very complicated).
          I also fix C as the reference because the piece is in C major.<br><br>

          Since the mapping changes depending on how we interpret enharmonic spellings, as an example, if we take the sonority in measure 28 as
          <span class="u-subTxt">G–E♭–A–C–F♯</span> and interpret the last note as <b>F♯ (Note 1)</b>, then replacing each note with just-intonation ratios gives:
          <span class="u-subTxt">3/8, 3/5, 5/6, 1/1, 45/32</span>.<br><br>

          If instead we interpret the last note as <b>G♭ (Note 2)</b>, then the ratios become:
          <span class="u-subTxt">3/8, 3/5, 5/6, 1/1, 36/25</span>.<br><br>

          I believe this difference can affect the performance approach.
          If we interpret it as F♯, the color leans more toward the overtone side; if we interpret it as G♭, it leans more toward the undertone side.<br><br>

          The reason is as follows:<br>
          <span class="u-subTxt">
            45/32 can be understood as starting from C (1/1), moving to the 9th partial (9/1), then to the 5th partial (45/1),
            and finally bringing it back into the same octave by dividing by 32, yielding 45/32.
          </span><br>
          <span class="u-subTxt">
            36/25 can be understood as starting from C (1/1), moving to the undertone 5 (1/5), then to the 6th partial (6/5),
            then to the undertone 5 again (6/25), and finally moving to the 6th partial, yielding 36/25.
          </span><br><br>

          In other words, the former follows an overtone-oriented pathway, while the latter follows an undertone-oriented pathway.
          In this performance, I interpret it as <b>G♭</b>, because it feels more strongly like it functions as a dominant-like sonority.<br><br>

          <span class="u-subTxt">
            Note 1: If D is taken as a major whole tone 9/8, then multiplying by 5/4 gives F♯ (9/8 × 5/4 = 45/32).<br>
            Note 2: 6/5 × 6/5 = 36/25.
          </span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Closing note:</b><br>
          Overall, I feel this prelude has relatively little “chaos” in its overtone structure; for that reason,
          I tried to shape the entire performance with an awareness of rich overtones and changes of color.

        <ul class="p-ai_txt">
          <li>
            <b>Global reference framing:</b> The analysis treats C (Do) not as a chord root but as a stable reference axis for mapping local sonorities to ratio-structures,
            making the prelude readable as a continuous “relation-to-C” network rather than a sequence of functional roots.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Local consonance via ratio choices:</b> In measure 2, prioritizing pure internal consonances (F–A as 5/4; A–D as 3/2) yields D = 10/9 relative to C,
            showing how one sonority can imply different “best-fit” ratios depending on which interval-relations are privileged.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Syntonic comma as a conceptual warning label:</b> The 81/80 discrepancy illustrates how chained pure intervals can accumulate mismatch in strict JI,
            while 12-TET functions as a stabilizing framework that prevents “drift” inside the work as written.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Interpretation at m. 28 (F♯ vs G♭):</b> The enharmonic choice is framed as a shift in pathway logic:
            45/32 as an overtone-leaning route vs 36/25 as an undertone-leaning route, directly tied to a performance decision about harmonic character.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Color strategy:</b> The performance approach is described as overtone-rich by default, with undertone-oriented darkness/weight emphasized in minor-sounding regions,
            and with a special focus on bringing out the distinct color-change around m. 28.
