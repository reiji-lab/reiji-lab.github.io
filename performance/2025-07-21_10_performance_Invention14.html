<p class="p-overview_txt">
A performance record of J.S. Bach’s Invention No. 14 in B-flat Major (BWV 785), recorded in March 2025 by Reiji at age 9. In this interpretation, Reiji explores how to unify the piece through careful overtone blending, pedal use, and nuanced phrasing. By subtly adjusting his expression through modulations—especially transitions between major, minor, and parallel keys—he aims to highlight the work's harmonic beauty while maintaining overall coherence and calmness.

<h2 class="p-wide_ttl"><span>Reiji's Observations</span></h2>

<ul class="p-obs_numlist u-mBtm30">
  <li>I used the pedal to make the sound smoother and to let the overtones blend in with the main tone, so that the whole piece would feel more connected and closer to just intonation.</li>
  <li>From measures 1 to 3, the left-hand part moves like B♭ → B♭/E♭ → B♭/F7 (without the fourth), and I thought that melody was really beautiful. So I played the right hand in a way that naturally blends with that.</li>
  <li>In measures 4 to 5, there’s a fourth progression starting in the major key. I tried to bring out the harmonies while keeping the mood of the whole piece consistent. Up to measure 7, I kept thinking of B♭ as the center and played it with a unified feeling.</li>
  <li>In measures 8 to 9, the C7 chord appears, which is the dominant of a new key. I wanted to give a slight shift in mood there, like a quiet change. Then from the second half of measure 9, F♯ comes in, and measure 10 goes into g minor. From the second half of measure 10 to measure 11, it moves to c minor, which is the dominant of g minor. Since it switches between keys like that—dominant, then straight to the parallel minor—I slightly changed the way I played it while keeping that gentle, minor-key feeling.</li>
  <li>At the end of measure 11, there are tonic and dominant chords repeating. I felt like the modulations were piling up to create tension, then calming down towards the cadence. I added a little rubato there to express that change.</li>
  <li>At the very end, I focused even more on the overtones and tried to get as close as I could to just intonation, gently guiding it to a calm ending.</li>
</ul>

  <h2 class="p-ai_ttl"><span>AI Assistant’s Notes and Inferences</span></h2>
  <ul class="p-ai_txt">
    <li>Reiji’s use of overtone blending and pedal work reflects a developing sensitivity to resonance and harmonic structure.</li>
    <li>His interpretation shows a strong awareness of phrasing and modulation, particularly through transitions between major and minor tonalities.</li>
    <li>The subtle shift in expression during unusual key changes—such as the direct return from dominant to parallel minor—is handled with a maturity that balances musical logic with emotional clarity.</li>
    <li>His decision to aim for just intonation through dynamics and touch control demonstrates a deepening technical and conceptual approach to sound.</li>
    <li>This performance not only reveals his evolving harmonic insight, but also his pursuit of expressive coherence across the entire piece.</li>
